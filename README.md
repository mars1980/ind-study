##Assignments
####Weekly Blogging Assignments
1. **Readings:** Post a short response to the readings weekly. Please post by Sunday evenings to give me enough time to read and comment. 
2. **Field Journal:**  Using research, direct observation, and artistic experimentation - examine, interrogate and intervene on a specific place that is a common/daily part of your life. Use whatever methodologies are most comfortable to you: programming, drawing, writing, sound recording, etc. Also, as your practice progress, take on experimental forms of mapping, describing, and disrupting that space. The space is up to you but should be a specific, definable, and a space that you engage with regularly.

**Ex:**  Examining your subway commute: issues of personal space? Why are the chairs a certain way? Designed from spatial perspective or behavioral perspective? How does having poles in certain places change how people act? What are the spatial politics of these spaces? What mechanisms of power are being hidden, subverted, or enforced?
