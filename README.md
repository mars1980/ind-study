##Assignments
####Weekly Blogging Assignments
1. **Readings:** Post a short response to the readings weekly. Please post by Sunday evenings to give me enough time to read and comment. 
2. **Field Journal:**  Field journals are a away to experiment and play in developing a spatial practice. They are a way to chart your weekly progress in terms of putting the readings and research into practice. Use this prompt as a starting point and see what develops from there:
 1. Using research, direct observation, and artistic experimentation - examine, interrogate and intervene on a specific place that is a common/daily part of your life. Use whatever methodologies are most comfortable to you: programming, drawing, writing, sound recording, etc. Also, as your practice progress, take on experimental forms of mapping, describing, and disrupting that space. The space is up to you but should be a specific, definable, and a space that you engage with regularly. Think about medium and how your medium translates to spatial practice. Seek out new ways to create space. 
 

**Ex:**  Examining your subway commute: issues of personal space? Why are the chairs a certain way? Designed from spatial perspective or behavioral perspective? How does having poles in certain places change how people act? What are the spatial politics of these spaces? What mechanisms of power are being hidden, subverted, or enforced?

####Final Project
Using the spatial practice you've developed on a weekly basis, critically examine and intervene upon  a space, whether public, private, virtual, or someplace in between. Please also attend one session of [crit group](http://itp.nyu.edu/groups/crit/) in the month of April. The final project will be broken down into the following components:

1. **Statement of Inquiry** -  Write a blog post outlining what you are interested in exploring for your final project. Think about place, methodology, and sociopolitical agendas. What are the questions you are interested in addressing? How does spatial practice enable you to tackle those questions? What's your trajectory? What do you want to spend the next 10 weeks exploring?
2. **Research** -  What's been done, What are the tools, What is the 'data set' you'll be working with?
3.  **Proposal** - Write a blog post outlining your final project proposal. We'll meet this week to discuss each other's proposals. Include the following information:
  1. Description of Work 
  2. Timeline and Production Schedule
  3. Central question or questions posed by the work
4.  **In Progress Meeting** - group in progress crit
5.  **Final Project Critiques** - Presentation of Final Project to guest critics. Please also submit documentation of projects and a blog post statement about the work onto your blogs.
